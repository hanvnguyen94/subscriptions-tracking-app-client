# Subscriptions Tracking App

This full-stack application got inspired by the traditional To-Do List has two resources. There are user and subscription. The user will be able to create an account and organize their "online subscriptions", which helps them avoid paying extra fee when their free trial is over.

## Planning Story
This project was created with logic steps as below:
- Create User Stories
- Create Wire Frames
- Create ERD (Entity RelationShip Diagram)
- Set Up HTML and GitHub repositories for front-end and back-end files
- Make API routes
- Make curl scripts to test API
- Debug API
- Make Client Site
- Connect API with Client
- Debugging on both sites
- Final Touches
